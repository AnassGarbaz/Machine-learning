# Machine-learning

## Classification folder  ( Predict if a person has COVID-19 or not ) :

In the Classification folder i made 5 models to predict COVID-19 in a person by his "age","sex","pO2_saturation","temperature" 

### Models :

1- KNN
2- SVM
3- Decision trees
4- RandomForest
5- Logistic Regression 

Finaly, i used a pipline to choose the best Model from this 5 models.

#### For best Prediction i used a "Ensemble Learning" from the 5 models to predict if a person really has COVID-19 or not.

## Forest fire prediction file :

I used Ridge regression with grid search to predict the area that will be burned, based on some features like temperature...etc. 


## discretization project file :

I trained a simple data with just one standarization and another discretization data on different ML models, then I compared them to see which ones work best using Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest. 
As i explained what discretization means, i explained models that i used and the data preprocessing step by step.
